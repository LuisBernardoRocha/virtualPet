#./commandeFeline/

./cF/ is an object oriented virtual pet that I created for my front-end development project while attending the Full Stack Immersive Program at Galvanzie in San Francisco. This project was meant to showcase our understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

./cF/ is simple: upon loading the page you are prompted to name this kitty. From there, you click the "start" button to initialize the game.

The commandFeline has three meters: happiness, hunger, and health. High happiness, low hunger, and high health are most desirable. As time goes on these levels change. You can directly affect this levels by clicking corresponding buttons: play, feed, and medicate. Our Feline's sprite reacts appropriately based on how it's feeling.

The game can end 1 of 2 ways: 

1) You neglect your feline and it dies. 

2) You take such good care of your feline that it rages the age of 20. At this age, it gloriously ascends into heaven thanking you for the life that you gave it.

**though this is called the ./commandFeline/, the actual command line is not used for interaction. It was simply a clever pun ** 

This is my first ever web dev project! I am very proud of what I have made and am thankful that you checked this out!
